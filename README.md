#Task 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This task was focused on cleaning the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning models.

Steps I Followed: 

1. Handled Missing Data:

    Filled missing values in numerical columns (like age) using mean or median
    Dropped or encoded rows/columns with too many missing values

2. Converted Categorical Data:

    Applied pd.get_dummies() to convert categorical columns (like sex, embarked) into numerical form

3. Feature Selection:

    Removed irrelevant features (like Name, Ticket, Cabin
    Selected key features to keep for model training

4. Final Cleaned Dataset:

    Ensured there were no missing values
    Dataset was ready for model building in future tasks
